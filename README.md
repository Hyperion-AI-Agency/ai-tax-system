## What this is

A production-safe pattern for extracting structured data from uploaded tax documents (1099s, 1040s, K-1s, Schedule C) and handing off to Intuit ProConnect or DrakeTax.

Most AI tax workflows ship as impressive demos and fall apart on the first scanned 1099 or handwritten return. This reference shows the pattern that survives real documents: OCR before LLM, per-field confidence scoring, human review queue for anything below threshold, and PII redaction before any prompt touches Claude.

## Why this exists

- **OCR before LLM** - pre-parse document structure rather than dumping pixels into an LLM
- **Confidence scoring per field** - every extracted value carries a score; nothing auto-exports below threshold
- **Human review queue** - low-confidence fields route to a CPA before anything reaches ProConnect
- **PII redaction before prompts** - SSNs and ITINs tokenised before hitting the LLM
- **Append-only audit trail** - every mutation logged immutably for compliance
